Rectangle selector square shape and centering
---------------------------------------------

When changing an existing `~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector` interactively,
the shape can now be kept square or rotated/resized around its center.
The square shape can be defined in data or display coordinate system as defined
by the *data_coordinates* modifier.
