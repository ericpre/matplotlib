Rectangle selector square shape and centering
---------------------------------------------

When changing an existing `~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector` interactively,
the shape can now be kept square or changed around its center. The square shape
can be defined in data or figure coordinates as determined by the
``data_coordinates`` modifier.
